# Python game collection



This is some of my attempts to use `pygame` for game development. The games are mainly based on the classic video games, and I will do some interesting experiments as well if I have ideas.

## Snake

Snake was a famous video game back in 90s, simple yet amusing. Currently, the basic concepts have been implemented (except the obstacles and levels). The record can be maintained during the running of the game.

Some more features are also under development, such as obstacles, levels, and many more game modes.
